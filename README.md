# MR Cardio
This extension is focused to provide a set of modules of segmentation, registration and cardiac image analysis.

# Modules Descriptions

**AD:** This module allows the application of the anisotropic diffusion filter in cardiac images

**FractalDimenson:** This module allows the measuring of fractal dimension of myocardium edges (Box Counting) and fractal dimension of myocardium (Differencial Box Counting)

**GeodesicActiveContour:** This module allows the segmentation of myocardium in SPECT and MR images

**HoughTransform:** This module allows the detection of circular objects in images 

**QEntropy:** This module allows the measuring the threshold of maximization of Tsallis Entroy (q-entropy)

**SampleEntropy:** This module allows the measuring the Sample Entropy of myocardium in SPECT and MR images

**Strain:** This module allows the detection of displacement fields of cardiac motion

**Texture Features:** This module allows the measuring of Haralick Descriptors of myocardium in SPECT and MR images

**Tickness:** This module allows the measuring of myocardial tickness in differents segments
